Hello there,

In order to run the application you need to generate your own api key on:
https://newsapi.org/

Then you have to paste the key to the config file so you actually get a valid response from the server.

As soon as you do that you can try to either:
yarn install or
npm i

When it succeeds you have to start the application by using either:
yarn start or
npm start

In case the port :3000 is not occupied and you didn't change any settings the application should start there automatically,

Have fun.
