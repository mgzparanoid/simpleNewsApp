Hello there,



In order to run the application you need to have both
>Node.js and NPM or Yarn installed

You should also clone the reponsitory from here
>https://github.com/mgzparanoid/gnNewsPrivate.git

Then generate your own api key on:
> https://newsapi.org/

If you've managed to get your key, you should paste it to the config file so you actually get a valid response from the server.

As soon as you do that you can try to either:
>yarn install 
>or 
>npm i

When it succeeds you have to start the application by using either:
>yarn start or
>npm start

In case the port :3000 is not occupied and you didn't change any settings the application should start there automatically,

Have fun.
